# Change subdeck's configuration
Allow you to change the options of subdecks.
## Usage
In the main window, on the right of add-on lines, there is a gear
button. In this gear, a new option is added. It will ask you the name
of the option you want to use, the depth at which this change should
be done (0 is current deck. 1 is children decks, which is the default
configuration. 2 Are the great-children decks, and so-on.). And at
which depth you want change to end. (Choose 1 if you want changes to
apply to children, but not to their descendant, etc...).
